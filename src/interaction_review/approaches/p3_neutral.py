"""P3-neutral (test A2) - Deterministic pipeline with a NEUTRAL partition of guidelines.

Overfitting control (R-A of the TESTPLAN): 'normal' P3 groups the guidelines into 5
SEMANTIC blocks made by hand knowing the case (p3_pipeline.BUCKETS). If that
fine-tuned grouping were the source of the advantage (and not the decomposition itself), P3
would not generalize: it would be overfitting to the case.

P3-neutral uses the partition from the AUTHORS THEMSELVES, already present in the data: the
`group` field of each guideline (the 4 phases of HAX-18: Initially / During /
When wrong / Over time; and the 6 PAIR chapters). There is no hand
design: the blocks are DERIVED from the data. If P3-neutral ~= P3 in recall, the advantage
is DECOMPOSING, not my blocks -> the improvement generalizes.

Same FIXED flow as P3 (one focused pass per block -> merge); the only thing that
changes is how the guidelines are grouped. It is still a pipeline, NOT an agent.
