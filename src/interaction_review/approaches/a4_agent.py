"""A4 - Agent: loop with control flow decided by the MODEL (not by code).

Key difference from P3 (fixed pipeline): P3 ALWAYS sweeps the same blocks. A4 makes
an initial broad pass and then, on each iteration, the MODEL decides (looking at what
it has so far) which areas are missing and whether another pass is worth it or it should stop.
That autonomy (what to investigate and when to finish, based on the state) is what makes it an agent.

Anti-loop guardrail: MAX_ITERS bounds the number of iterations (there is no open loop).
