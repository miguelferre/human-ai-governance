"""Review approaches (the plan's 'complexity ladder').

They all share the same signature so the comparison is fair:

    run(dossier: Dossier, guidelines: list[Guideline]) -> list[Finding]

Ladder:
  - b0: deterministic checklist (no LLM). The floor.
  - b1: single zero-shot prompt.           (F2)
  - b2: single few-shot prompt.            (F2)
  - p3: deterministic pipeline (NOT an agent). (only if the data calls for it)
  - a4: agent.                             (only if the data calls for it)
