"""Finding deduplication: the missing PRODUCT step.

The persistent anti-pattern of P3 (and worse in p3n): the block-by-block sweep emits the
SAME problem several times, usually citing a different guideline each time
(e.g. "onboarding sin reciclaje" appeared 7 times via HAX-G1, HAX-G12, PAIR-UN-2,
PAIR-MM-1, PAIR-EF-2, PAIR-DE-1...). ~60-100 findings for ~15 real problems.
A human auditor does not want to read the same problem five times.

This step COLLAPSES near-duplicate findings into one representative that MERGES the
guidelines of all its members. The output is "one finding per problem, annotated
with all the guidelines it violates" -> more actionable, not less.

Principles (consistent with the project, see ADR-004): it is DETERMINISTIC and lives in the
CODE, without an LLM. It does not look at the golden or the adjudications (in production they do not exist):
it groups only by the CONTENT of the finding. The similarity is lexical (not deep
semantic) on purpose: reproducible, auditable and free. The validity of the threshold is
measured separately (scripts/dedup_report.py) against adjudications that this step never sees:
it must not merge distinct real problems (purity) nor lower the coverage (recall).

The grouping is by REPRESENTATIVE (not single-linkage): each finding is compared with
the representatives of the already-open clusters and joins the most similar one above the
threshold, or opens a new cluster. It avoids the transitive chaining (A~B, B~C => A~C) that
would over-merge. The result is stable with respect to the input order (that of the sweep).
