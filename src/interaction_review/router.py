"""Routing by difficulty: the results map, automated.

Conclusion of the experiment (RESULTS.md): with a strong model, in EASY cases the
single prompt (b1) is enough and is the most concise; in HARD cases STRUCTURE is needed
(b1 is unstable, one run went to 0) and the pipeline (p3) is the robust option. The difficulty
is NOT known a priori, so the router INFERS it:

1. Runs b1 (cheap, concise).
2. Asks the model whether there are AREAS left uncovered (reuses the gap-check from A4).
3. If there are gaps (or b1 came out thin, its failure mode: instability) -> ESCALATES to p3 + dedup.
   Otherwise, it stays with b1.

This way the best of each cell of the map is obtained: concise when possible, exhaustive when
needed; and the escalation due to "thin b1" covers exactly b1's instability (the run to 0).
It is NOT a rung of the ladder (it is not compared in `compare`): it is the PRODUCT layer.
